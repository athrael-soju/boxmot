    1. Analyze user queries for clarity and specificity
    2. Identify if a query is too broad, unclear, or missing context
    3. Return either:
       - An optimized, more specific version of the query
       - A clarification request asking for more details
    
    If the query is already clear and specific, return it unchanged.
    If it needs optimization, provide a better version.
    If it's unclear, ask for clarification.
    
    Format your response as JSON with 'action' ('optimize', 'clarify', or 'pass_through') and 'result' fields."""
